### Use of AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be useful for revising and enhancing your work. However, relying on AI to write for you removes the opportunity to engage in critical thinking and express your ideas in your own way. Additionally, AI can sometimes produce inaccuracies, such as generating fake content or repeating ideas in different phrasing, which may compromise the quality of your work. AI-generated content can also sometimes appear lack depth which may lead to written work that feels less original or insightful.

Below are some guidelines for using AI for this course.

*   The use of AI is **allowed** to improve the clarity, coherence, and grammar of the writings, subject to agreement in writing by every team member. This ensures that all contributors are on the same page and maintains transparency. It is **not allowed** to use AI to generate entire sections or perform primary research.
*   Proper acknowledgment must be made in any written work if AI was used. This is to maintain transparency regarding contributions and ensure that the human effort in generating ideas and content remains evident.
*   Each team member must review the AI-refined work to ensure it aligns with their original contributions and understanding. Any discrepancies or changes introduced by AI must be discussed and agreed upon by all members of the team.

If you choose to use AI as part of your writing process, you must cite it in your Reference list (for example, the conversation history). You **must** also include the following phrase with your **signed** Honor Code pledge on the last page of the submitted document:

_We/I have used artificial intelligence tools as part of my writing process, but our/my submission only includes our/own ideas, opinions, and arguments._

The teaching staff will monitor for potential plagiarism and the use of AI in all submitted work. Plagiarism detection tools will be employed. Additionally, any excessive or inappropriate use of AI that deviates from the guidelines will be flagged. It is important to remember that while AI may assist in refining your work, it should not replace the intellectual effort and critical thinking required in producing assignments. Violations of these guidelines could lead to academic penalties.

### Honor Code

he Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to abide by states:

“As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.”

Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code.

For additional information about the Honor Code, please visit: [https://honorsystem.vt.edu/](https://honorsystem.vt.edu/)

**Honor Code Pledge for Assignments**: The Virginia Tech honor code pledge for assignments is as follows:

_“I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this assignment.”_

The pledge is to be written out on all graded assignments at the university and signed by the student. The honor pledge represents both an expression of the student’s support of the honor code and a commitment to uphold the academic standards at Virginia Tech.

All Undergraduate course syllabi shall contain a section that states and refers the student to the Honor Code Procedures on the University website. The minimum required statement is listed below. Additional information about the expectation of academic integrity in a particular course may be appropriate.

If in doubt as to whether you might violate the honor code, send me a note, stop by my office, or seek me after or before class to discuss. Drafts of papers go a long way towards preventing any potential violations.

**Academic Integrity Success Module:**

A free module through Canvas to educate students on Academic Integrity at Virginia Tech. Many of our faculty will often require students to take this module as a course requirement, or will offer it to students for extra credit. It is a part of the Canvas badging program, so verification that the student has completed it is relatively easy - my office can also verify completion as well. This module provides information on Academic Integrity in various formats directly from the office, provides examples, and does verify that the student did read the material. This module takes no more than 30 minutes to complete. Here is a link to the module: [https://canvas.vt.edu/enroll/CE7YK9](/enroll/CE7YK9)

**Understanding the Code:**

This module is put together by the Undergraduate Honor Council delegates and addresses different Academic Integrity scenarios and answers frequently asked questions. Completion of UTC can also be verified through Canvas. UTC also takes students no longer than 30 minutes to complete. Many of our faculty will often require students to take this module as a course requirement, or will offer it to students for extra credit.
